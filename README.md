The bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current dataset is sourced from the US Social Security Administration (SSA). 
This public dataset in BigQuery contains information about the frequency of names given to babies born in the United States, based on data provided by the SSA. 
My IoD (Data and AI cohort, Australia & NZ, August 2025) class visited a similar set, which only covered until 2013. 
This dataset selected for this project runs from 1910 to 2021; in the eight years since the first data set was updated, there have been a number of global changes including population shifts in response to economics, 
immigration policy, war, increased access to technology, and a surge in the use of social media. 
Could the eight years from 2013 to 2021 show us new cultural changes in naming practices?
I grouped states into divisions and regions, and compared naming patterns.
I also considered "neutral" names.
My definition of unique/unusual/uncommon names relates to usage of <= 10,000 usages of a name. The full dataset contains > 6million observations.
